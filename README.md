# Mushroom-classification
## Can we classify mushrooms as edible or poisonous using ML techniques?

We first started with EDA to check for imbalances in the data, before preprocessing and training classifier pipelines including a Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest. We evaluated feature importance in the RF model and performed appropriate hyperparamater tuning. For clustering analysis, we used dimensionality reduction methods with PCA, K-Means with PCA, and K-Means with t-SNE.
